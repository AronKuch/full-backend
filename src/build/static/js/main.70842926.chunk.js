Instead I\u2019m crammed in the corner of a hospital room, Heather groggily waking up from the procedure, a doctor younger than I giving us details we\u2019ll eventually have two recollections about and trying to express an urgency with terms like \u201cmalignancy\u201d without freaking us out by saying \u201ccancer\u201d. I guess TV & movies don\u2019t always get it right. Still the news hits us like a ton of feathers, still weighs as much as a ton of bricks, but a much slower drop. We knew from a regular ultrasound that there was a 4 inch growth, and we didn\u2019t elect for an endoscopic ultrasound because it sounded enjoyable, so this isn\u2019t a big shock to us. It was a possible outcome. We\u2019re partly glad that we have less unknown, a direction to head. It also sucks that it\u2019s cancer. I think a result like \u201cwe don\u2019t know what it is, but it\u2019s definitely not cancer\u201d would have been better, but that\u2019s not what we got. I don\u2019t know if the correct setting would have made a difference.</p>"},{name:"01162021",title:"Communication",datetime:"2021-01-16T15:00:00-05:00",content:"<p>I\u2019m avoiding researching things online. Part of me thinks this is good. The last thing I want to do is be awake at 3 am reading about liver enzyme synthesis, wondering if I still have an organic chemistry textbook that I could do some reading up in. I suppose this is a lesson learned from COVID: interesting research topic + stressful situation = sleepless nights. Another part of me thinks I\u2019m avoiding the problem.</p><p>Perhaps there\u2019s a website that explains how to communicate a cancer diagnosis with your family, friends & coworkers. Heather told her coworkers on Thursday. I was inclined to keep the business owners in the loop so they weren\u2019t surprised if she\u2019s working weirder hours, etc. The feedback she\u2019s getting from other coworkers is more of the annoying \u201cmy mother had cancer and\u2026\u201d kind of stories. I\u2019m immensely skeptical about one where the person healed themselves by diet, and very curious if it\u2019s a coincidence that I\u2019ve heard it three times from Heather, or if she\u2019s really clinging to the story like an emotional life-preserver.</p><p>We told her parents right away on Wednesday, which prompted a phone call from her sister. Since my mom and stepdad are here and knew about Wednesday\u2019s procedure I told them on Thursday, but with the explicit instruction to not tell my brothers; I love them but I\u2019m afraid of this story getting out. I\u2019m working hard on the spin control. I don\u2019t want people to overreact, in part because so far we don\u2019t know how much reaction is under/over and Heather and I are choosing to reserve our reaction for enough facts to warrant a reaction. I\u2019d also like to avoid being annoyed by the \u201cis there anything I can do question\u201d or other signs of concern. I want signs of concern, just not too many. So when I emailed my office some details on Friday at 4:45 and told them to not reply to my email, I was still checking my email over the weekend for the person that would ignore my request, and then getting disappointed when there wasn\u2019t any sort of message because I did want to be important to people.</p><p>So I set a Zoom to tell my brothers and my dad. It\u2019s difficult to coordinate something and invite people to a conversation with a certain level of importance without giving away the details. The child-free request was particularly challenging because I knew once the 3, 4, 5, 6 year olds get on the call, they can quickly consume it. It all came together, although there\u2019s a certain weirdness to \u201clet\u2019s get everybody together for a 5 minute announcement\u201d. Certainly had the feel of work meetings that stop being useful before the hour is up, but nobody knows how to say that everything is accomplished. There were a couple of follow-up questions, but everybody is either stunned or realises that there aren\u2019t enough details yet to make too much conversation. Even the nieces and nephews made cameos but failed to relieve the awkwardness.</p><p>I still haven\u2019t told too many people at church. There\u2019s too much variation in the experience with cancer to share broadly. Also I\u2019d really like to not answer a bunch of questions.</p>"},{name:"01202021",title:"No News",datetime:"2021-01-20T16:00:00-05:00",content:"<p>The GI doctor said that he was sending the results and giving us a referral to an oncologist and that we should hear by Friday.

Still not a  ton of bricks, but definitely not a ton of feathers. What\u2019s between? How about a ton of water, I think that\u2019s a little less than 250 gallons, sounds about right. Also how else are you supposed to take \u201cpoorly differentiated squamous cell metastatic carcinoma\u201d. Oh, you\u2019re not a medical professional; let\u2019s break it down, backwards.</p><p>Carcinoma: Cancer, that\u2019s one\u2019s easy</p><p>Metastatic: Spreading, not good</p><p>Squamous cell: Cells that make up the external layer, like skin, but also places where the outside meets the insides, like sinuses, esophagus, lungs, anus, bladder. I.e. not the liver. (Also \u201csquamous\u201d is a fun word to hear and say.)</p><p>Poorly differentiated: Not showing an obvious starting location</p><p>A series of tests on the biopsy samples failed to indicate the origin of the squamous cells. So we know there\u2019s a big lump in the liver, and that it\u2019s messing with things, but it didn\u2019t start there so treating that only means another comes back. Also, since there are lesions on both livers it would probably mean removing nearly all of the liver, which is a bit too much, given that we can\u2019t get a transplant because if the cancer source is uninterrupted, then it\u2019ll just ruin the transplant. There may be treatments (surgery, radiation, injected medicine) to shrink it and alleviate the symptoms, but more information is needed to determine if that happens. It probably ended up in the liver because the liver filters the blood.</p><p>Since we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s coming from, we\u2019ll have to wait on treatment. To learn it\u2019s origin story, we\u2019re starting with a PET scan, in which Heather will get injected with radioactive \u201csugar\u201d and the cancerous parts are sugar fiends, so they should light up like Christmas lights. But the brain is also a sugar fiend, so if there\u2019s any there, it won\u2019t show. Give a couple of symptom questions Heather answered yes to, like balance issues, a brain MRI is also ordered to rule things out. The blood work didn\u2019t show anything outside of the ordinary, so that means that things haven\u2019t completely fallen apart. It\u2019s also odd that Heather had a wide series of doctors check-ups last year that didn\u2019t find anything: dermatologist, pap smear, mammogram, colonoscopy.</p><p>I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve had an hour-and-half conversation with a doctor. At least not one that wasn\u2019t a friend of mine and then we were talking about things other than medicine. So the doctor is definitely personable. Plus he\u2019s willing to really explain things. And he was willing to discuss the unknowns and the uncertainties. I also liked how he really considered the whole of Heather (I would use the word \u201cholistic\u201d but that has a different meaning around herbal remedies, acupuncture, etc.) such as trying to figure out where her cough originates and what can be done about her neck pain. In that regard, he cleared the regular taking of Aleve, as in 2 pills a day for multiple days. Given how effective they\u2019ve been with the neck pain, I am very excited for this news. Also he had strict instructions about not losing any more weight. Particularly the doctor doesn\u2019t want Heather to give up on eating because it\u2019s such a vicious cycle. So while healthy is preferred, calories are what count.</p><p>Yeah, it\u2019s a lot. Today was a lot.
